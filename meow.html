            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The electric guitar came into being in the 1930s, mainly as a response to the need for a louder guitar sound in large bands, especially in jazz music. Charlie Christian, a jazz musician, was one of the first people to adopt the electric guitar, which was basically an acoustic guitar with additional pickups to amplify the sound. Leo Fender designed the first solid-body electric guitar in the 1940s, and by the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar had become a mainstay of popular music genres like rock and roll.</p>
